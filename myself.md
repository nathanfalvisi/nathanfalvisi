Hey, my name is Nathan! 21y Brazilian. My interests in general are gaming, going to gym and doing some trails.
I used to be a competitive player on World of Warcraft Classic during the pandemics. Used to stay on the top 50's - 100's during 2 tiers as a Rogue, played with the name Sangx,
on Netherwind-US.
Currently doing a Computer Science degree on PUC-MG, in Poços de Caldas - MG. Since i'm still on a early state of my degree, i'm mostly learning C and a little of Java.
Also learned the basics of Html, CSS and Javascript few months ago.
My main language is Portuguese, and i'm also a English speaker. My English still need some work around it, although i'm also working on it, since i constantly watch videos, streams, 
and texts in English. I did English classes until i was 15, but most of it, such as abreviations and slangs, i learned playing WoW with foreigners (both americans and europeans).
I don't know exactly where i want to work and how in the future, but i think a lot about NASA and SpaceX, since i'm also into astronomy and pretty interested about the subject.

To be continued.
